Computer vision project that we made for BOSM 2024. It utilises pre-trained models from the YOLO framework that are fine tuned to fit our training data. We keep track of certain parameters in the match footage and analyse it.  
  
**Parameters**:  
* Ball tracking - Used a tracker from supervision library and annotated using openCV
* Player detection
* Dividing players into distinct teams based on jersey colour, using openCV
* Speed of players and distance travelled
